# SHAIL v2 on Apple Silicon

In SHAIL v2, we plan to create a self-hostable package that can install on others' Apple Silicon Machines.

## 1. Create selfhostable Package = DMG file

1a. compiled binaries for llama.cpp. Bring the compiled llamacpp binaries into a local folder 'llama.cpp/'. Update the binaries to the relative path.

```sh
install_name_tool -add_rpath ./llama.cpp ./llama.cpp/llama-server
```


1b. add a sample model to use in the 'models/' folder

Let use the 1.5B 6-bit model **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-Q6_K.gguf**
    at <https://huggingface.co/bartowski/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-GGUF>

```sh
huggingface-cli download bartowski/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-GGUF --include "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-Q6_K.gguf" --local-dir ./models
```

1c. create a DMG file 'shail2.dmg' from these pieces

```sh
hdiutil create -srcfolder dmg-shail2 -volname "SHAIL v2" -ov shail2.dmg
```

## 2. Add the Self-hostable package

We now have this self-hostable package (DMG) file at [Shail v2 Instruct (DMG)](./releases/shail2-instruct.dmg). Download and copy the files to a local folder.

## 3. Run the Self-hostable package

Go to the local folder where the DMG files are installed.

```sh
# !/bin/bash
# prepare the environment
install_name_tool -add_rpath ./llama.cpp ./llama.cpp/llama-server
chmod +x ./runmodel.sh

```

Use the following to run the model

```sh
./runmodel.sh
```

voila! Your local hosted model should be alive.

Access the local model at <http://localhost:8090>
